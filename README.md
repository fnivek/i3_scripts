# Kevin's I3 Scripts
I use these scripts along with I3 to make i3 behave the way I want it to.
For example the `workspace` script navigates through numbered and grouped workspaces.
Where grouped workspaces can represent a project.

## Poetry default instructions:
To get started, run the following:

```
$ nix develop
$ poetry run python -m sample_package
Hello, world!
```
